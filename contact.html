	<p>Hello, Oliver here! I am a machine learning student at <a href="https://www.aalto.fi//" target="_blank">Aalto university</a> pursuing my M.Sc. I am currently working on data-efficient reinforcement learning in Aalto university's <a href="https://research.cs.aalto.fi/bayes/" target="_blank">deep learning group</a>. 
		I aim to document my learning notes in this blog and hope that you will find these notes helpful. If you find any errors, please feel free to contact me: oliver.jarnefelt@gmail.com</p>
	
	<p>This blog is inspired by the excellent <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/" target="_blank">learning notes</a> by Lilian Weng</p>
