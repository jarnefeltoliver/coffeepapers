	<p>Hello, Oliver here! I am a machine learning student at <a href="https://www.aalto.fi//" target="_blank">Aalto university</a> pursuing my M.Sc. I am currently working on data-efficient reinforcement learning in Aalto university's <a href="https://research.cs.aalto.fi/bayes/" target="_blank">deep learning group</a>.</p> 
	
	<p>I aim to document my learning notes in this blog. Tentatively, the core topic will be reinforcement learning but in general this will be a platform
	for things I find interesting at a particular moment. Additionally, I hope that someone will find these entries to be an easy entry point to RL literature.
	As this is aimed to be a learning diary, errors are likely to occur; if you find any errors, please feel free to contact me: oliver.jarnefelt@gmail.com</p>
	
	<p>This blog is inspired by the excellent <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/" target="_blank">learning notes</a> by Lilian Weng.</p>
